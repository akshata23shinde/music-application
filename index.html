        Music is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of
        melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.It is one of the universal cultural
        aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include
        common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm
        (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics
        (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture
        (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different
        styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of
        these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and
        vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely
        instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without
        instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and
        instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική, mousiké, '(art) of the
        Muses'. In its most general form, the activities describing music as an
        art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music
        (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study
        of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient
        Greek and Indian philosophers defined music in two parts: melodies, as
        tones ordered horizontally, and harmonies as tones ordered vertically.
        Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to
        my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to
        listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any
        sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise, only
        sound."
